# Overview

This program was created to learn the basics of the Kotlin language.
* ADDED: Learning how to add a cloud database to the software.

The software I used was IntelliJ IDEA.  This software specifically has Kotlin libraries installed and available.

The purpose of this software is to provide a user with a platform to track their debts.

# Future Work

* Would like to add more to the calculations function where the user could factor in the interest rates of the debt.
* I would also like to connect the calculations function in with the LineItems class so the data could be pulled from the map.
* I would also like to create a user interface.
* On the Display function I need to fix when there is a longer named item it disaligns the total on the right.

{ADDED: Cloud Database}
* more stuff
