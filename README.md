# Future Work

* Would like to add more to the calculations function where the user could factor in the interest rates of the debt.
* I would also like to connect the calculations function in with the LineItems class so the data could be pulled from the map.
* I would also like to create a user interface.
* On the Display function I need to fix when there is a longer named item it disaligns the total on the right.
